In the last couple days I completely rewrote the module in the previous article. It still needs a lot of work and tweaks. As I learn more and more about standards and conventions, I'm redesigning and reworking the project. It's definitely a fun learning experience.

So. At this point. Definitely not "production ready".

The goal is to have it available on cpan for any computer with Perl to be able to grab the module and use.

Anyways. Fun continues!
