Working With Strings.

33:13


- String Methods, sometimes called. "String Functions".
- String methods are little blocks of code that modify or give information about a string.
- Methods act on strings and allow you to modify the string contents or find out information about them.
- Google for "Ruby String Methods." - For a list of methods you can use with strings.

Examples. ex.

string = "content"
puts string.upcase() - Changes everything in string to uppercase.
puts string.downcase() - Changes everything in string to lowercase.
puts string.strip() - Leading and trailing whitespace gets deleted.
puts string.legnth() - Tell me how many characters are inside a string. (Including whitespace.)
puts string.include? "content" - Returns a Boolean true or false if the string contains the word content.
puts string[0] - Access the first character of the string a 'c' in this case.
puts string[0,3] - Access a range of characters in a string.
puts string.index("c") - Return index position number of the character 'c' in the string.
puts "content".upcase() - Methods work on both variables or strings directly.
