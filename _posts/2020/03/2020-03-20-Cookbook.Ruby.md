Notes on watching the YouTube video [Ruby Programming Language].

Working With Strings.

33:13


- String Methods, sometimes called. "String Functions".
- String methods are little blocks of code that modify or give information about a string.
- Methods act on strings and allow you to modify the string contents or find out information about them.
- Google for "Ruby String Methods." - For a list of methods you can use with strings.

More Resources on other [String Methods].

Examples. ex.

```ruby
string = "content"
puts string.upcase() #- Changes everything in string to uppercase.
puts string.downcase() #- Changes everything in string to lowercase.
puts string.strip() #- Leading and trailing whitespace gets deleted.
puts string.size #- Tell me how many characters are inside a string. (Including whitespace.)
puts string.include?("content") #- Returns a Boolean true or false if the string contains the word content.
puts string[0] #- Access the first character of the string a 'c' in this case.
puts string[0,3] #- Access a range of characters in a string.
puts string.index("c") #- Return index position number of the character 'c' in the string.
puts "content".upcase() #- Methods work on both variables or strings directly.
```

Math & Numbers
44:03

- Working with numbers in Ruby.

Using basic numbers.
```ruby
puts 5 #- Prints out the number 5.
puts 5.123 #- Prints out the decimal number 5.123.
puts -5.123 #- Prints out negative numbers.
```
Basic Arithmetic.
```ruby
puts 5 + 9 #- Addition. => 14
puts 5 - 9 #- Subtraction. => -4
puts 5 * 9 #- Multiplication => 45
puts 5 / 9 #- Division => 0

puts 5 ** 3 #- Exponential. (5 to the power of 3) => 125
puts 10 % 3 #- Modulus Operator. (10 divided by 3 spit out the remainder.) => 1
```

- Numbers can be stored inside of a variable.
```ruby
num = 20
puts num
```
- Numbers and strings can be printed out inside the same print statement.
```ruby
num = 20
puts ("My favorite number is :" + num.to_s) #- The .to_s converts the number into a string.


```
