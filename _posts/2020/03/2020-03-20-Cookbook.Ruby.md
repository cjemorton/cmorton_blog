As I go through and Learn Ruby. Here are some of my notes.


Notes on watching the YouTube video [Ruby Programming Language].

## Working With Strings.

33:13


- String Methods, sometimes called. "String Functions".
- String methods are little blocks of code that modify or give information about a string.
- Methods act on strings and allow you to modify the string contents or find out information about them.
- Google for "Ruby String Methods." - For a list of methods you can use with strings.

More Resources on other [String Methods].

Examples. ex.

```ruby
string = "content"
puts string.upcase() #- Changes everything in string to uppercase.
puts string.downcase() #- Changes everything in string to lowercase.
puts string.strip() #- Leading and trailing whitespace gets deleted.
puts string.size #- Tell me how many characters are inside a string. (Including whitespace.)
puts string.include?("content") #- Returns a Boolean true or false if the string contains the word content.
puts string[0] #- Access the first character of the string a 'c' in this case.
puts string[0,3] #- Access a range of characters in a string.
puts string.index("c") #- Return index position number of the character 'c' in the string.
puts "content".upcase() #- Methods work on both variables or strings directly.
```

## Math & Numbers
44:03

- Working with numbers in Ruby.

### Using basic numbers.
```ruby
puts 5 #- Prints out the number 5.
puts 5.123 #- Prints out the decimal number 5.123.
puts -5.123 #- Prints out negative numbers.
```
### Basic Arithmetic.
```ruby
puts 5 + 9 #- Addition. => 14
puts 5 - 9 #- Subtraction. => -4
puts 5 * 9 #- Multiplication => 45
puts 5 / 9 #- Division => 0

puts 5 ** 3 #- Exponential. (5 to the power of 3) => 125
puts 10 % 3 #- Modulus Operator. (10 divided by 3 spit out the remainder.) => 1
```

- Numbers can be stored inside of a variable.

```ruby
num = 20
puts num
```

- Numbers and strings can be printed out inside the same print statement.

```ruby
num = 20
puts ("My favorite number is :" + num.to_s) #- The .to_s converts the number into a string.
```

- In addition to working with standard numbers. We can also use something called a method.
- A method is a block of code we can call that will either modify the number or give information about the number.
- Sometimes a method can also do mathematical calculations on the number.

- Method to find the absolute value of a number. The absolute value of a number is never negative.

```ruby
num = -20
puts num.abs() #- Give me the absolute value of a number. Without the negative. => 20
```

- Method to round a number.

```ruby
num = 20.487
puts num.round() #- Will round the number. => 20

num = 20.648
puts num.round() #- Rounding a number. => 21
```

- Ceiling and floor methods, are also referred to as functions.
- Ceiling will always take the higher number.
- Floor will always take the lower number.

```ruby
num = 20.1
puts num.ceil() #- Will give us the highest number. => 21

num = 20.9
puts num.floor() #- Returns the lowest number. => 20
```

- Other special methods from within math class.
- There is this 'entity' inside of ruby called math class that can be used to perform special math operations on numbers.
- Inside the Math class, there are methods.

```ruby
puts Math.sqrt(36) #- Square root method. => 6
puts Math.log(1) #- Logarithmic. => 0.0
```

### There are several more [Math Functions and Methods] available they are.

- Math Constants.
- A list of constants can be accessed by using the constants method.

```ruby
Math.constants #- The ones currently defined are. => ["PI", "E"]
```

- We can access these constants using the :: notation.

```ruby
Math::PI #- Prints out pi. => 3.14159265358979
Math::E #- Prints out E. => 2.71828182845905
```

### Ruby Math Methods.

- Ruby provides a range of math related methods.

| Method Name | Description |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
Math.acos, Math.acos! |Arc cosine
